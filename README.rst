How to write a good bug report
------------------------------

Reporting bugs is critical to software development (we can't fix bugs we are
not aware of).  While reporting bugs is both necessary and helpful, it is
critical to ensure that the reports are *good* bug reports.  For bug reports
to be helpful to your friendly software developers, they need to be

- **Short.** Most bugs can be produced in a few lines of code.  Keeping the code
  short helps to convince the developers the bug is in *their* code not *your* code
- **Self contained.** Include everything needed to replicate the bug
- **Correct.** We should be able to copy/paste/run the code to reproduce the bug.
  If you are unsure how to reproduce the bug, providing a comprehensive
  description of *what* you did to (or what you were doing when) you encountered
  the bug is a reasonable substitute.
